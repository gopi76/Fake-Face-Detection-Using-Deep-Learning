# Fake-Face-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

## Mini Project (Associated with Deep Learning Subject [INT422] at Lovely Professional University)

- Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using Keras and TensorFlow for binary image classification tasks.
- Employed advanced data augmentation techniques including rotation, shifting, zooming, and flipping to enhance the diversity of the training dataset and improve model generalization.
- Implemented model optimization techniques such as early stopping and model checkpoint callbacks to monitor validation loss and preserve the best-performing model during training.
- Evaluated model performance through visualization of training and validation loss and accuracy curves using Matplotlib.
- Created a function to make predictions on new images, which involved loading, preprocessing, and utilizing the trained CNN model to classify images as "Real" or "Fake".
